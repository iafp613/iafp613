# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nacho Fontal

### About me

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science. I want to specialize in the area of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

I love to study, learn and keep growing. Being constantly evolving is something that makes me feel good. I come from the worlds of gastronomy and nursing, but I always liked programming and computer science.

In 2020, due to the SARS-CoV, I started studying the Python programming language on my own.
After discovering all the options that I had if I learned Python, I began to investigate some of them: mobile application development, web development, desktop applications... Finally, the option that most seduced me was Data Science, specifically the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I am training as a Data Scientist to be able to enter in this exciting world. Also, I try to help other people follow a good learning path to learn independently.

I hope you can learn a lot from my profile and, above all, enjoy doing it!!
